Preprocessing
Done ---- replace word numbers by number numbers
DONE ---- define an ambiguous language and check that all the transcripts conform to it
issue with transcript 13/985160.txt
"ith element of list"
DONE ---- delete comments
DONE ---- upper case all True/False
REMOVED ----- For statement statement block rule not nice
DONE ----- look at append and check they are used consistantly

DONE ----- string const removal? and number const removal
string const removal in transcript?
DONE ----- representing indexing? currently just [ i ]
manual additions to the symbol to name mapping
DONE ---- specific string const for "newline"
DONE ---- "end for" only removes the end in the baseline -> reduced the minimum edit distance by 5.58% (625-> 590)
"set VARIABLE to" and "add VARIABLE to" "initialize VARAIBLE as" in baseline to VARIABLE
"empty" or "empty list" => []
"and" is an issue
"that value" => most previous variable (or x in the case of for x in y....)
(1+2)*5 in pseudo code means we have to have brackets in transcripts which is annoying
DONE ---- "at index" "VARIABLE of VARIABLE " "indexed at" "value of VARIABLE at the key VARIABLE" indexing represented differently from [] represent as x[y] => x index(y)
          "looking up VARIABLE in VARIABLE" "VARIABLE position VARIABLE" 588->580
change how token to symbol works by added the key words at the end
DONE --- "increment VARIABLE" => 590->588 - improved by stemming
not sure I like += being considered two tokens? one conceptual idea just map plus equal to it?
        "is less than or equal to" as above
"for each VARIABLE between NUMBER and NUMBER"
DONE ----- lemmatization and stemming ect
normalization relevant?
done ----- note that have used case folding --- all lower case
look at byte pair encoding instead of the porter stemmer?

In alignment look at mapping some tokens deterministically such as variable

improve the get_alignment function in file ibmmodel1
clean up project files
might be worth splitting up transcript/pseudocode into terms for word alignment
---> also changing how variables work


in SMT if word maps to VARIABLE and it is not VARIABLE then set to next best / NULL

Look into viterbi algorithm and see if it is useful

Could train the tokenizer on python files

priorities:
1) data
2) have a quick look into features specified above
2) other systems specified by paula
3) read J & M link:(https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) chapters:2âˆš,3,7,9,12,17,20,22+ for hand crafting 11
