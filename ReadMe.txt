//Imagine you were telling me how to write these functions without worrying too much about the exact syntax:
//For example for factorial I might say:
// is a function named factorial which takes a number and if that number is 0 or 1 it gives 1
// else it multiplies number multiplied by factorial of number-1
//
// notes: int can be taken read as integer and float as decimal
//      * is multiplication
